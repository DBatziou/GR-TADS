# 🇬🇷 TADS 3 Greek Extension

This project is an experimental extension for TADS 3 (Text Adventure Development System), aiming to bring Greek language support into interactive fiction.
The focus is on:

Handling Greek characters properly in TADS 3.

Supporting basic grammar rules (declensions, conjugations, cases).

Making it possible to write interactive fiction entirely in Greek.

## 🚀 Features (Work in Progress)

✅ Greek character set support.

✅ Basic nouns and verbs.

✅ Gendered articles and cases (nominative, genitive, accusative, vocative).

🛠️ Plans for gendered articles and cases fixes.

🛠️ Future work on verb conjugations and tense handling.
