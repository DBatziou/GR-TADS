     *   For example, rather than typing "x flashlight", we could allow the

     *   those games.  Shorter lengths are superficially more convenient

     *   shorter truncation lengths create more potential for ambiguity.
     *   For some games, a longer length might actually be better for the

     *   The library only looks at it once, during library initialization
     *   at the very start of the game.  If you want to change the
     *   truncation length dynamically, you must instead create a new

     *   with that word in its list.
     *   
     *   The idea is that you set up the object's "static" vocabulary with
     *   the *complete* list of words for all of its possible states.  For
     *   example:
     *

     *
     *   In rare cases, it might be desirable to override this.  In

     *   basic equivalents of one another (which means that the parser
     *   will always ask for disambiguation when the two are ambiguous

     *   the same as the string returned by self.name), then we simply
     *   return self.theName.  Since the base name is the same in either
     *   case, presumably the definite article names should be the same as
     *   well.  This way, if the object overrides theName to do something
     *   special, then we'll use the same definite-article name for
     *   disambiguation prompts.
     *
     *   If the disambigName isn't the same as the regular name, then
     *   we'll apply the same algorithm to the base disambigName that we
     *   normally do to the regular name to produce the theName.  This
     *   way, if the disambigName is overridden, we'll use the overridden
     *   disambigName to produce the definite-article version, using the
     *   standard definite-article algorithm.
     *
     *   Note that there's an aspect of this conditional approach that
     *   might not be obvious.  It might look as though the test is
     *   redundant: if name == disambigName, after all, and the default
     *   theName returns theNameFrom(name), then this ought to be
     *   identical to returning theNameFrom(disambigName).  The subtlety
     *   is that theName could be overridden to produce a custom result,
     *   in which case returning theNameFrom(disambigName) would return
     *   something different, which probably wouldn't be correct: the
     *   whole reason theName would be overridden is that the algorithmic
     *   determination (theNameFrom) gets it wrong.  So, by calling
     *   theName directly when disambigName is the same as name, we are
     *   assured that we pick up any override in theName.
     *
     *   Note that in rare cases, neither of these default approaches will
     *   produce the right result; this will happen if the object uses a
     *   custom disambigName, but that name doesn't fit the normal
     *   algorithmic pattern for applying a definite article.  In these
     *   cases, the object should simply override this method to specify
     *   the custom name.

    /*
     *   Conjugate a regular verb in the present or past tense for our
     *   person and number.
     *
     *   In the present tense, this is pretty easy: we add an 's' for the
     *   third person singular, and leave the verb unchanged for plural (it
     *   asks, they ask).  The only complication is that we must check some
     *   special cases to add the -s suffix: -y -> -ies (it carries), -o ->
     *   -oes (it goes).
     *
     *   In the past tense, we can equally easily figure out when to use
     *   -d, -ed, or -ied.  However, we have a more serious problem: for
     *   some verbs, the last consonant of the verb stem should be repeated
     *   (as in deter -> deterred), and for others it shouldn't (as in
     *   gather -> gathered).  To figure out which rule applies, we would
     *   sometimes need to know whether the last syllable is stressed, and
     *   unfortunately there is no easy way to determine that
     *   programmatically.
     *
     *   Therefore, we do *not* handle the case where the last consonant is
     *   repeated in the past tense.  You shouldn't use this method for
     *   this case; instead, treat it as you would handle an irregular
     *   verb, by explicitly specifying the correct past tense form via the
     *   tSel macro.  For example, to generate the properly conjugated form
     *   of the verb "deter" for an object named "thing", you could use an
     *   expression such as:
     *
     *   'deter' + tSel(thing.verbEndingS, 'red')
     *
     *   This would correctly generate "deter", "deters", or "deterred"
     *   depending on the number of the object named "thing" and on the
     *   current narrative tense.

     *   an apostrophe-S.  If the name is plural, and it ends in an "s",
     *   we'll just add an apostrophe (no S).  If it's plural and doesn't
     *   end in "s", we'll add an apostrophe-S.
     *
     *   Note that some people disagree about the proper usage for
     *   singular-usage words (especially proper names) that end in 's'.
     *   Some people like to use a bare apostrophe for any name that ends
     *   in 's' (so Chris -> Chris'); other people use apostrophe-s for
     *   singular words that end in an "s" sound and a bare apostrophe for
     *   words that end in an "s" that sounds like a "z" (so Charles

     *   when ending with an "s": "Chris's", "Charles Dickens's".  That's

     *   Note that this algorithm doesn't catch all of the special
     *   exceptions in conventional English usage.  For example, Greek
     *   names ending with "-es" are usually written with the bare
     *   apostrophe, but we don't have a property that tells us whether the
     *   name is Greek or not, so we can't catch this case.  Likewise, some
     *   authors like to possessive-ize words that end with an "s" sound
     *   with a bare apostrophe, as in "for appearance' sake", and we don't
     *   attempt to catch these either.  For any of these exceptions, you

     *   name (singular, plural, or a "mass noun" like "lint"), and our
     *   spelling.
     *
     *   By default, we'll use the article "a" if the name starts with a
     *   consonant, or "an" if it starts with a vowel.
     *
     *   If the name starts with a "y", we'll look at the second letter;

     *   yttrium block" but "a yellow brick").

     *   Some objects will want to override the default behavior, because
     *   the lexical rules about when to use "a" and "an" are not without

     *   with "an", and "h" words with a pronounced but weakly stressed
     *   initial "h" are sometimes used with "an" ("an historian").  Also,
     *   some 'y' words might not follow the generic 'y' rule.
     *
     *   'U' words are especially likely not to follow any lexical rule -
     *   any 'u' word that sounds like it starts with 'y' should use 'a'
     *   rather than 'an', but there's no good way to figure that out just
     *   looking at the spelling (consider "a universal symbol" and "an
     *   unimportant word", or "a unanimous decision" and "an unassuming
     *   man").  We simply always use 'an' for a word starting with 'u',
     *   but this will have to be overridden when the 'u' sounds like 'y'.

     *   we'd normally use for the basic name.  For example, the ordinary

     *   We use this hook to implement the special tense-switching syntax
     *   {<present>|<past>}.  Although it superficially looks like an
     *   ordinary substitution parameter, we actually can't use the normal

     *   allow the <present> and <past> substrings themselves to contain

     *   for recursive substitution.

     *   We simply replace every sequence of the form {<present>|<past>}
     *   with either <present> or <past>, depending on the current
     *   narrative tense.  We then substitute braces for square brackets in
     *   the resulting string.  This allows treating every bracketed tag
     *   inside the tense-switching sequence as a regular substitution
     *   parameter.
     *
     *   For example, the sequence "{take[s]|took}" appearing in the
     *   message string would be replaced with "take{s}" if the current
     *   narrative tense is present, and would be replaced with "took" if
     *   the current narrative tense is past.  The string "take{s}", if
     *   selected, would in turn be expanded to either "take" or "takes",
     *   depending on the grammatical person of the subject, as per the

     *   match tree is the specific Action subclass associated with the
     *   grammar for the predicate.  This means that the Action associated

     *   by returning the match itself: it is the Action as well as the

     *
     *   This approach ('grammar predicate' matches are based on Action

     *   role of each phrase in the word order of the sentence.
     *
     *   Languages that encode phrase roles using case markers or other
     *   devices tend to be freer with word order.  As a result,
     *   'predicate' grammars for such languages should generally not

     *   capturing the possible overall sentence structures independently
     *   of verb phrases, and plug in a verb phrase as a component, just
     *   like noun phrases plug into the English grammar.  In these cases,
     *   the match objects will NOT be Action subclasses; the Action
     *   objects will instead be buried down deeper in the match tree.
     *   Hence, resolveAction() must be defined on whatever class is used
